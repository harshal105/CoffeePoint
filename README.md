# CoffeePoint

## Introduction
A full-stack web application that shares information about coffee â˜•. Users are able to view any particular coffee in the database, and learn some information about
it. Users can also add, edit, or delete a particular type of coffee on the website as well!

## How was it made?
The app was built using the MERN stack, where a REST API was created on the back-end using Express & MongoDB to handle any changes to the different coffees in the 
database. The front end was built using React, and styled using vanilla CSS. 

## Motivation
I built this project as a way to understand more about web development, and put some of what I knew to practical use. I was also curious on how the frontend and 
the backend of applications communicate, and this project allowed me to learn more about creating APIs that allowed information to be transferred from the client to the backend. I'm hoping to use this knowledge to create more complex applications in the future and challenge my understanding of full-stack development.
