# CoffeePoint

## Introduction
A full-stack web application that shares information about coffee ☕. Users are able to view any particular coffee in the database, and learn some information about
it. Users can also add, edit, or delete a particular type of coffee on the website as well!

## How was it made?
The app was built using the MERN stack, where a REST API was created on the back-end using Express & MongoDB to handle any changes to the different coffees in the 
database. The front end was built using React, and styled using vanilla CSS. 

## Motivation
I built this project as a way to understand more about web development, and put some of what I knew to practical use. While this isn't the most complex application,
I was able to learn a lot about how web applications are built, and am hoping to continue to learn more!
